# SWE-bench Accuracy Smoke-Test Runbook

End-to-end validation for the SWE-bench accuracy pipeline. Unit tests mock all
subprocesses, so running the real pipeline is the only way to catch Docker,
HuggingFace access, or mini-swe-agent wiring issues.

## 0. Preconditions

- Docker daemon running on the SWE-bench service host.
- Docker Hub auth or a pre-seeded image cache on the service host.
- Network egress to PyPI and HuggingFace Hub from the service host.
- Endpoint URLs reachable from the service host.
- `uv` binary on PATH (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`).
- Parent endpoints env already synced (`uv sync --extra dev` from repo root).

## 1. Start the SWE-bench service

From the repo root:

```bash
uv run --project src/inference_endpoint/evaluation/swebench_service \
  python -m swebench_service --host 0.0.0.0 --port 18080
```

Sanity check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:18080/health
```

## 2. End-to-end test (requires live endpoint)

```bash
uv run inference-endpoint benchmark from-config \
  --config examples/10_Agentic_Inference/swe_bench_accuracy.yaml \
  --mode both
```

`--mode both` is required: `type: online` configs default to `TestMode.PERF`,
which skips accuracy datasets.

Scorer preflight calls the service `/health` endpoint. It does not check Docker
or pre-pull images on the benchmark client.

The service is trusted infrastructure. It receives endpoint URLs and optional
endpoint credentials, runs Docker-backed evaluations, and serves artifacts. For
non-loopback deployments, bind it on a private network or start it with
`--auth-token TOKEN` and set
`accuracy_config.extras.swebench_service_auth_token: TOKEN`.

Qwen SWE-bench configs may opt into `enable_swebench_toolcall_patch: true` and
`swebench_template: qwen_tools`. That path builds a temporary minisweagent
package overlay with replacement files packaged with the service, prepends it to
`PYTHONPATH` for the agent run, and leaves the installed package untouched.
Leave this flag unset for Kimi and other non-Qwen runs.

## Common failure modes

| Symptom                              | Likely cause                              | Fix                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `swebench_service_url is required`   | Client config missing service URL         | Set `accuracy_config.extras.swebench_service_url`  |
| Service health check fails           | Service not running or unreachable        | Start the service or fix client-to-service routing |
| Docker error during `run_evaluation` | Docker daemon not running on service host | Start Docker on the service host and retry         |
