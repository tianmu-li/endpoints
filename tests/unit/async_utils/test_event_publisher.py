"""Unit tests for EventPublisherService and event publish/subscribe flow.

Uses a test subscriber that collects received EventRecords for assertions.
Follows the same flow as scripts/zmq_pubsub_async_utils_demo.py:
- Subscribers use their own event loop (not the publisher's), running in a separate thread.
- .start() is scheduled on the subscriber's loop via call_soon_threadsafe so the reader
  is registered on the correct loop.
- Allow time for subscribers to connect (ZMQ slow-joiner) before publishing.
- Publish EventRecord instances (same API as the demo).
- process() is async and scheduled via create_task. Wait conditions use asyncio.Event.
