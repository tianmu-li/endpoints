    """ZMQ PUB socket publisher generic over message type T.

    Records are buffered in memory and flushed as a single msgpack-encoded
    batch when the buffer reaches ``send_threshold``. This reduces syscalls
    from one per record to one per batch (~19x throughput, ~29% smaller).

    The ``send_threshold`` is the *minimum* number of records in the buffer
    before an automatic flush is triggered. There is no maximum — records
    accumulate until the threshold is reached or ``flush()``/``close()``
    is called explicitly. Callers that need immediate delivery (e.g.
    session control events) should call ``flush()`` after publishing.
    Setting ``send_threshold=1`` effectively disables batching: every
    publish is sent immediately as a single record without batch overhead
    via the ``len(buf) == 1`` fast path in ``_flush_batch``.

    Batching protocol:
      - Batched messages use ``BATCH_TOPIC`` as the ZMQ routing prefix.
      - The payload is ``msgpack(list[bytes])`` where each element is a
        pre-encoded record payload (no per-record topic prefix).
      - Subscribers unpack the list and yield payloads in insertion order.
      - Per-record topics are omitted because the codec-decoded item
        already carries any dispatch information.
      - Single-record flushes use the record's own topic (no batch overhead).

                each publisher in the system has a distinct path.

                guarantees buffered records are sent. 0 drops in-flight on
